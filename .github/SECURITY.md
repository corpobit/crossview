# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** report security vulnerabilities in public GitHub issues.

Report them privately by emailing the maintainer:

- **Moeid Heidari:** moeid.heidari@corpobit.com

Include a clear description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and the impact you believe it has. We will acknowledge receipt and aim to respond within a reasonable time.

## Supported versions

Security updates are provided for the latest major release and the previous major release when feasible. We encourage upgrading to the [latest release](https://github.com/corpobit/crossview/releases).

## Disclosure

We will work with you to understand and fix the issue. We ask that you allow time for a fix before making any public disclosure. After a fix is released, we can coordinate on disclosure (e.g. release notes, CVE if applicable).
